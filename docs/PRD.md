# Product Requirements Document - Manus Engine

## Overview

Manus Engine is a native macOS application that enables AI-powered Roblox game development through multi-agent collaboration. The system uses a Council of specialized AI agents to analyze code, propose improvements, and provide evidence-based recommendations.

## Problem Statement

Roblox developers face challenges with:
- Performance optimization in complex games
- Code quality and maintainability
- Testing and validation at scale
- Keeping up with best practices
- Debugging performance issues

## Solution

A Council-driven AI system that:
1. **Analyzes** code for performance and quality issues
2. **Proposes** improvements through specialized agents
3. **Validates** proposals with evidence collection
4. **Synthesizes** recommendations for implementation
5. **Integrates** with existing development workflows

## Core Features

### 1. Council Chamber
- **Multi-agent collaboration** with specialized roles
- **Real-time session monitoring** and status tracking
- **Proposal visualization** with confidence scores
- **Evidence integration** from sandboxed providers
- **Synthesis results** with actionable recommendations

### 2. Code Editor
- **Luau syntax highlighting** and validation
- **Git integration** for version control
- **Council context** with inline suggestions
- **Quick Council access** via right-click menu
- **File browser** with project organization

### 3. Evidence System
- **Sandboxed providers** for security
- **Static analysis** (Luau linter)
- **Unit testing** with coverage analysis
- **Performance profiling** and benchmarking
- **Extensible architecture** for new providers

### 4. Orchestrator Service
- **State machine** for Council sessions
- **Agent coordination** and message routing
- **Evidence collection** and validation
- **Synthesis generation** from multiple proposals
- **REST API** for external integration

## User Personas

### Primary: Roblox Developer
- **Experience**: Intermediate to advanced
- **Goals**: Improve code quality and performance
- **Pain Points**: Performance bottlenecks, code maintenance
- **Workflow**: Uses Roblox Studio, version control, testing

### Secondary: Team Lead
- **Experience**: Advanced, manages teams
- **Goals**: Ensure code quality and team productivity
- **Pain Points**: Code review overhead, performance issues
- **Workflow**: Reviews code, manages projects, mentors

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance improvement**: 20%+ reduction in CPU usage
- **Code quality**: 90%+ test coverage
- **Response time**: <5 seconds for Council sessions
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ of proposals are actionable

### User Metrics
- **Adoption rate**: 70% of target users
- **Session frequency**: 3+ Council sessions per week
- **Satisfaction score**: 4.5/5 average rating
- **Time savings**: 50% reduction in debugging time

## Technical Requirements

### Platform
- **macOS 14+** with native SwiftUI app
- **Python 3.11+** for backend services
- **Xcode 15+** for development

### Architecture
- **Microservices**: Orchestrator, Agents, Evidence
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized agent communication
- **Sandbox Security**: Isolated evidence providers
- **REST APIs**: Service communication

### Performance
