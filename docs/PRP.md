  - State machine for Council workflow
  - Agent coordination and message routing
  - Evidence collection orchestration
  - Synthesis generation

#### 2. Agent System
- **Technology**: Python with MCP protocol
- **Purpose**: Specialized AI agents for different domains
- **Agents**:
  - **CodeMaster**: Performance optimization and refactoring
  - **TestBot**: Testing strategy and validation
  - **ScriptDoctor**: Code quality and security review

#### 3. Evidence System
- **Technology**: Python with sandboxed execution
- **Purpose**: Validating agent proposals with concrete evidence
- **Providers**:
  - **Luau Linter**: Static analysis and style checking
  - **Unit Test Runner**: Test execution and coverage
  - **PerfProbe**: Performance benchmarking

#### 4. macOS Application
- **Technology**: SwiftUI with Combine
- **Purpose**: Native user interface for Council interaction
- **Features**:
  - Council Chamber for session monitoring
  - Code Editor with Luau support
  - Console for logging and debugging

### Data Flow

1. **User initiates Council**: Right-click file â†’ "Ask Council"
2. **Orchestrator creates session**: Generates unique session ID
3. **Agents receive context**: All agents get problem description
4. **Proposals generated**: Each agent creates initial proposal
5. **Evidence collected**: Relevant providers validate proposals
6. **Synthesis created**: Orchestrator combines insights
7. **Results presented**: User sees actionable recommendations
