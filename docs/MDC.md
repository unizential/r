# Model-Driven Council (MDC) - Technical Architecture

## Overview

The Model-Driven Council (MDC) is the core AI architecture that powers Manus Engine. It implements a multi-agent collaboration system where specialized AI agents work together to analyze code, propose improvements, and provide evidence-based recommendations.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Specialized Agents
Each agent has a specific domain expertise and role:
- **CodeMaster**: Performance optimization and refactoring
- **TestBot**: Testing strategy and validation
- **ScriptDoctor**: Code quality and security review

### 2. Evidence-Based Validation
All agent proposals are validated through sandboxed evidence providers:
- **Static Analysis**: Luau linter for code quality
- **Dynamic Testing**: Unit test execution and coverage
- **Performance Profiling**: Benchmarking and metrics

### 3. Collaborative Synthesis
The orchestrator combines agent insights into actionable recommendations:
- **Proposal Ranking**: Confidence-based scoring
- **Evidence Integration**: Validation results weighting
- **Synthesis Generation**: Consensus building algorithms

## Agent Architecture

### Base Agent Interface

```python
class MCPAgent(ABC):
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str, role: str, capabilities: List[str]):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.role = role
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_proposal(self, context: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Generate a proposal for the given context"""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_critique(self, proposal: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Generate a critique of the given proposal"""
        pass
```

### Agent Communication Protocol

All agents communicate using the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "message_id": "agent_timestamp",
  "agent_id": "code_master",
  "agent_role": "scripting",
  "council_id": "uuid",
  "round": 1,
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "capabilities_used": ["static-analysis", "patch-generation"],
  "content": {
    "type": "proposal",
    "summary": "Switch to event-driven cache",
    "rationale": [...],
    "artifacts": {...},
    "confidence": {...}
  }
}
```

## Council Workflow

### 1. Context Broadcast
- User initiates Council session with file context
- Orchestrator creates session and broadcasts to all agents
- Agents receive problem description and constraints

### 2. Proposal Collection
- Each agent generates initial proposal based on expertise
- Proposals include rationale, artifacts, and confidence scores
- Orchestrator collects all proposals for review

### 3. Critique Round
- Agents review each other's proposals
- Constructive feedback and improvements suggested
- Endorsement levels and concerns documented

### 4. Evidence Phase
- Relevant evidence providers validate proposals
- Static analysis, testing, and performance metrics collected
- Evidence results integrated into proposal confidence

### 5. Synthesis Generation
- Orchestrator combines all insights using synthesis algorithms
- Consensus building on conflicting proposals
- Final recommendation with confidence scoring

### 6. User Decision
- User reviews synthesis and evidence
- Can request additional evidence or agent input
- Decision to apply, modify, or reject recommendations

## Evidence System

### Provider Interface

```python
class EvidenceProvider:
    def __init__(self, provider_id: str, capabilities: List[str]):
        self.provider_id = provider_id
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        
    async def run_evidence(self, inputs: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Run evidence collection in sandbox"""
        pass
```

### Sandbox Security

All evidence providers run in isolated sandboxes:
- **Memory limits**: 512MB maximum
- **Execution timeouts**: 30 seconds maximum
- **File system restrictions**: Read-only access to specified files
- **Network isolation**: No external network access
- **Resource monitoring**: CPU and memory tracking

### Threat Model (STRIDE-lite)
- Spoofing: Authn on MCP endpoints, agent registration signing
- Tampering: JSON schema validation, immutability for audit logs
- Repudiation: Structured audit logging with correlation IDs
- Information disclosure: Least-privilege tokens, redaction in logs
- Denial of service: Rate limiting, timeouts, circuit breakers
- Elevation of privilege: RBAC, capability checks per tool

### Evidence Types

#### Static Analysis
- **Luau Linter**: Syntax checking and style validation
- **Security Scanner**: Vulnerability detection
- **Complexity Analyzer**: Code complexity metrics

#### Dynamic Testing
- **Unit Test Runner**: Test execution and coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end validation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and profiling

#### Performance Analysis
- **PerfProbe**: CPU and memory profiling
- **Load Testing**: Stress testing under load
- **Memory Analysis**: Memory leak detection

## Synthesis Algorithms

### 1. Confidence-Based Ranking

```python
def rank_proposals(proposals: List[Dict], evidence: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
    """Rank proposals by confidence and evidence"""
    for proposal in proposals:
        # Base confidence from agent
        base_confidence = proposal["confidence"]["score"]
        
        # Evidence validation boost
        evidence_boost = calculate_evidence_boost(proposal, evidence)
        
        # Final confidence score
        proposal["final_confidence"] = base_confidence * evidence_boost
        
    return sorted(proposals, key=lambda p: p["final_confidence"], reverse=True)
```

### 2. Consensus Building

```python
def build_consensus(proposals: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    """Build consensus from multiple proposals"""
    # Group similar proposals
    proposal_groups = group_similar_proposals(proposals)
    
    # Find highest confidence group
    best_group = max(proposal_groups, key=lambda g: g["avg_confidence"])
    
    # Synthesize recommendations
    synthesis = {
        "mode": "consensus",
        "recommendation": combine_proposals(best_group["proposals"]),
        "confidence": best_group["avg_confidence"],
        "disagreements": identify_disagreements(proposals)
    }
    
    return synthesis
```

### 3. Evidence Integration

```python
def integrate_evidence(proposal: Dict, evidence: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Integrate evidence results into proposal confidence"""
    evidence_score = 0.0
    
    # Static analysis results
    if "static_analysis" in evidence:
        static_score = evidence["static_analysis"]["status"] == "pass"
        evidence_score += static_score * 0.3
        
    # Test results
    if "unit_tests" in evidence:
        test_score = evidence["unit_tests"]["passed"] / evidence["unit_tests"]["total"]
        evidence_score += test_score * 0.4
        
    # Performance results
    if "performance" in evidence:
        perf_score = evidence["performance"]["improvement"] > 0
        evidence_score += perf_score * 0.3
        
    # Update proposal confidence
    proposal["evidence_boost"] = evidence_score
    proposal["final_confidence"] = proposal["confidence"]["score"] * (1 + evidence_score)
    
    return proposal
```

## Model Integration

### Language Model Integration

Each agent integrates with language models for:
- **Code Analysis**: Understanding code structure and patterns
- **Proposal Generation**: Creating detailed improvement suggestions
- **Critique Generation**: Providing constructive feedback
- **Synthesis**: Combining multiple perspectives

### Model Selection

- **Primary**: GPT-4 or Claude for complex reasoning
- **Secondary**: Specialized models for code analysis
- **Fallback**: Rule-based systems for reliability

## Conclusion

The Model-Driven Council architecture provides a robust foundation for AI-powered code analysis and improvement. The combination of specialized agents, evidence-based validation, and collaborative synthesis creates a system that can provide high-quality, actionable recommendations for Roblox developers.

The modular design allows for easy extension and improvement, while the sandboxed evidence system ensures security and reliability. As the system learns from user feedback and incorporates more sophisticated models, it will become an increasingly valuable tool for the Roblox development community.
